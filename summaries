We created an offline role playing storytelling game that is an educational resource that can also use online extensions. This RPG Storytelling game uses the GLOBE protocol datasets as a resource to allow players to use characters to tell and create stories. We encourage learning and exploration of the environment around them and encourage players to contribute the datasets that they find to the GLOBE protocol.

Players of the RPG can follow the stories and educational lessons provided or create their own, and use the companion program to view and submit datasets as they follow along and explore their environment. We also created a printable version of the game and a sample dataset that players can use if they have limited or no access to the internet or a computer. 

Additionally, we created a bonus game that uses the NASA APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API and the Open Trivia Database API.These additional games are designed as add-ons, enhancing the experience without replacing the core gameplay, and aim to create a pop culture-style game with multi-faceted marketing.
