Players must work through the scientific process—observing, questioning, hypothesizing, investigating, collecting data, analyzing, and communicating findings—all while exploring Earth in a collaborative adventure.

GLOBE Scientific Process Integration:

Ask Questions
Each mission starts with an inquiry-based goal that drives the players' research. For example, the question might be, "Why is the population of pollinators in the Whispering Forest declining?"

The Caterpillar Queens may lead brainstorming sessions to determine the potential causes of the issue, encouraging players to hypothesize based on observations.
Develop a Hypothesis
Players, based on their character strengths, propose hypotheses. For instance, Quantum Butterflies might hypothesize that pollutants in the forest air are affecting the pollinators.

Players document their hypotheses in a Mission Log, a record of all scientific ideas that will be tested.
Plan an Investigation
Using GLOBE Protocol resources, players will plan their investigation.

For example, if investigating water quality, the Moon Explorers may suggest using GLOBE’s Hydrosphere Protocol to collect samples from local water sources. Players decide what tools and procedures they will use based on GLOBE’s guidelines.
Collect Data
During the mission, players follow the GLOBE Protocol to gather data:

Atmosphere Protocol: The Crystal Moths use their bioluminescent abilities to measure atmospheric conditions like air temperature and humidity.
Hydrosphere Protocol: The Guardians of the Cocoon Kingdom collect water samples from a river using their advanced technology.
Pedosphere Protocol: The Chrysalis Shamans gather soil data to determine nutrient levels, moisture, and texture.
Players document their data using GLOBE Data Sheets, which are integrated as part of their Mission Report Cards. They follow proper methods from GLOBE Protocol resources to ensure accuracy, mimicking real-world data collection.
