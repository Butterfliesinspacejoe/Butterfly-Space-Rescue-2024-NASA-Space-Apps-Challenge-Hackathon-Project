EONET
More and more NASA imagery is being made available via web services (WMS, WMTS, etc.) and a significant percentage of it is being produced and published in near real time (NRT=within a few hours after acquisition). This ability means that NASA imagery can be used more routinely to examine current natural events as they happen.

Using client applications, such as NASA EOSDIS’ Worldview, users can browse the entire globe daily and look for natural events as they occur. Storms are regularly spotted in the tropics, dust storms over deserts, forest fires in the summers. These events are occurring constantly and NASA NRT imagery can represent them all using a variety of different data parameters. However, the user’s experience is tailored, and therefore restricted, by the client application. What if there was an API that provided a curated list of natural events and provided a way to link those events to event-related NRT image layers? Enter EONET.

The Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET) is a prototype web service with the goal of:

providing a curated source of continuously updated natural event metadata; providing a service that links those natural events to thematically-related web service-enabled image sources (e.g., via WMS, WMTS, etc.). Please see our API documentation to learn more about how to use the EONET web services.

Development of EONET began in 2015 and has been supported by NASA’s Earth Observatory and Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project.





Chat GPT:
Make API Requests
You can make requests to the NASA API using various methods, such as:

Web Browsers: Enter the API endpoint URL in your browser along with your API key.
cURL Command: Use the command line to make GET requests.
Programming Languages: Use languages like Python, JavaScript, or others to make HTTP requests.
Example (using Python):

python
Copy code
import requests

api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
url = f'https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key={api_key}'

response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()

print(data['title'])
print(data['url'])
print(data['explanation'])


Handle API Responses
The API will return data in JSON format. You’ll need to parse this data to extract the information you need. Most programming languages have libraries to handle JSON easily.
