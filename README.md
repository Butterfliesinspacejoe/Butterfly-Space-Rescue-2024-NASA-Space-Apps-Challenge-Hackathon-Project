The folder named "Globe Dataset Game" is the main RPG adventure game that uses the GLOBE Protocol Api as well as the NASA APOP Api.

the other folders contain the bonus trivia games and olderf versions of the RPG game.

Important- the files named “style” and “TheGame” must both be in the same folder or else the game will not run.
